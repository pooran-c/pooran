                <p>
    First and foremost, I love programming. I still remember, when I was first introduced to object-oriented programming in bachelor's, I was quite intrigued by how problems could be solved through the ideas of objects, inheritance, and abstraction. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle and I'm committed to solving it passionately. I think programming helps transmit our ideas in a structured and logical manner to solve a particular problem.</p>

    <p>For my first professional contract, I was given the opportunity to be part of complete software development life cycle, from creating a technical requirement, software coding phase till testing phase, which was e-commerce website in java/j2ee for Hewlett Packard. Later moved towards server maintenance and code deployment. Further, into Agile software development, Today I am an application developer at Fenecon Gmbh, developing controllers and devices which are controlled by these controllers in Energy management service(EMS).</p>

    <p>I tend to read data science blogs, machine learning (interest and curiosity that I picked up in my Master's studies) and write code at home after office hours. In free time, I follow Football leagues and get inspired by the hard work players put day-in-day-out of their careers, which challenges me in many aspects: teamwork, hard work, organization, problem-solving. This is what keeps me up at night, the never-ending thirst to learn and share it others.

    OpenEms is a modular energy management system based on the OSGi framework to control, 
    monitor and integrate renewable energy storage systems. As a application developer I have developed several controller
    APIs. One such controller was used to control the CHP (combined heat and power) device. I was involved in creating online monitoring of these
    devices, JUnit test cases, and documentation. I am aslo part of the Research project, Where we predict the PV energy production and also utility consumption using the artificial neural network and use this predicted data in controller to use the Energy efficiently.

          <p>This was Proof of concept, Plan was to create an in-house project in HP to manage the
    workflow from different customers(different regions of the worlds) and their order.
    Exposing each workflow as a REST API. I Worked in the Back-end team for creating the Rest
    API. This was developed using TIBCO Business Works and Java. I Built an HTTP PATCH
    library in java which helped efficient use of REST API instead of HTTP PUT operation. Which,
    the same library was re-used by other teams in HP.</p>

          <p>This project started as a small plan for tracking end to end events of orders from three
  customers for HP. I worked in Back-end, Where I had to build logic to convert data from
  three customers into a single type and store it in the database and log each event. This was
  developed using Oracle, SQL, Java, TIBCO Business Works. The project was successful for 3
  customers. This project was presented to many other customers.</p>

  designing technical requirements documents, construction and till rigorous testing phases.
  I learned to use Eclipse IDE, Java/J2EE (struts/springs framework) for construction, Oracle

then detect the sentiment of the classified migration tweet. The binary classifier is built
using a supervised machine learning algorithm. The important task involved was gathering
relevant data for building machine learning model and feature extraction. Overall,
detecting the sentiment of the human migration tweets my model achieved an accuracy of
55%.</p>
